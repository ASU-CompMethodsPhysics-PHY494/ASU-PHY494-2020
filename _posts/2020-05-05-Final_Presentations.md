title: Final Virtual Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of two or three students and presented results as recorded video presentations in a conference-like virtual setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor after the presentation [^1].

Ten teams looked at problems ranging from quantum mechanics to network theory applied to publishing and black holes gobbling up the solar system (or not).
Each team started with a proposal, defined goals, and used computational techniques learned during the semester to achieve their goals:

| #  | title  | team  |
|----|--------|-------|
| 1  | Spectrographic Projection as a Tool to Understand Rotations in Higher Dimensions | Geometree |
| 2 | Solving the Advection Equation  | Apples |
| 3 | Through the wormhole: using ray-tracing to visualize the wormhole of Interstellar | Project The Hans Zimmer Fan Club |
| 4 | Tight-binding Model for Graphene Monolayer | Kyber Crystal Engineers |
| 5 | Black Hole Terror: Replacing the Sun with a Black Hole of Equal Radius | Pickle Rick |
| 6 | Dynamics of the Solar System | Planet Pals |
| 7 | Quantum Mechanics that you can See | Dirac & Roll |
| 8 | Analysis of Journal Publication Behaviors via Bianconi-Barabasi Fitness Model of Dynamical Network | Robin Na |
| 9 | Periodic solutions of the 3-body problem | The Raviolis |
| 10 | Collapsing Psi! | PsiPy |

#### Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for 5 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A grade, which provides an individual component.
